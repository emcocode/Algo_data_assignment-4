Hello!

The files in this ZIP are the code, the report, the data txt-file and a visalization class (python).
To run the code, make sure the files are in the same folder and run them through your IDE. Also make sure to open the entire folder in the IDE to access the other classes (can be done using the command "code ." in git bash, while located in this folder). I have been using VSCode for the development.

Problem1: 
-   We print from the iterators: vertices, edges and adjacencies.

Problem2: 
-   We test the BFS/DFS and print as the vertices are called.

Problem3: 
-   We find the mst:s, print the connected components, print how many trees there are and how the trees look (vertices, edges and their weights).

Problem4: 
-   We run random graphs made of the data we can select in the variables in the main class.
-   We can make our own graphs in the runCertainGraphs() method, make sure to comment out/in the runRandomGraphs() in the main method in that case.
-   Construct these graphs in the runCertainGraphs() by adding edges manually. Make sure the boolean "negatives" is set to false if you want to use Dijkstra.

Problem5:
-   We check the input data and determine the topological ordering of the elements.

# Assignment 4 in Algorithms and datastructures

Problem1: 
-   We print from the iterators: vertices, edges and adjacencies.

Problem2: 
-   We test the BFS/DFS and print as the vertices are called.

Problem3: 
-   We find the mst:s, print the connected components, print how many trees there are and how the trees look (vertices, edges and their weights).

Problem4:
-   We run random graphs made of the data we can select in the variables in the main class.
-   We can make our own graphs in the runCertainGraphs() method, make sure to comment out/in the runRandomGraphs() in the main method in that case.
-   Construct these graphs in the runCertainGraphs() by adding edges manually. Make sure the boolean "negatives" is set to false if you want to use Dijkstra.

Problem5:
-   We check the input data and determine the topological ordering of the elements.
